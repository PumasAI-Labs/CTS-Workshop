# Advanced Clinical Trial Simulation Workshop

# Introduction
* {Note the wording of this section will be expanded}
* Intended for advanced users
* If not an advanced user, concepts will still be valuable and this example can be used as a mechanism for learning more advanced topics


# Prerequisites
* Familiar with modeling and simulation workflows in Pumas.
* Understanding of basic programming concepts (e.g., control flow, boolean operations, functions).
* Familiar with data types used in Julia and how to access information stored within them.

# Case Study

## Reference
* PK/PD model-informed dose selection for oncology phase I expansion: Case study based on PF-06939999, a PRMT5 inhibitor. doi: 10.1002/psp4.12882

## Overview
* Used PK/PD modeling to select a recommended dose (PF06) for expansion based on first in patient data collected from a Phase 1 dose escalation trial that included 28 patients with solid tumors.
    + 0.5-8mg PO q12h
    + 0.5-6mg PO q24h
* PF06 is a small molecule inhibitor of protein arginine methyltransferase 5 (PRMT5)
* Two PD biomarkers in study ("efficacy" and "safety")
    + Symmetrical dimethyl-arginine (SDMA): catabolic product of PRMT5 activity. Reduction in SDMA has been correlated with tumor response. Specifically a 78% reduction in plasma SDMA was shown to correspond with nearly complete inhibition of tumor SDMA.
    + Platelet count: thrombocytopenia is the most common adverse event for drugs in the same class.
* Grading (severity) of adverse events (thrombocytopenia)
    + G1 = <100 10⁹cells/L
    + G2 = <75
    + G3 = <50 (bad)
    + G4 = <25 (real bad)
    * 30-35% G3 or above acceptable

## Demographics
* Age (y): 63 (33, 85) median (min,max)
* TBW (kg): 89 (55, 137)
* Sex (M:F), 15:13
* Race (1:5), 3:25; 1=AA, 5=white
* Liver function (1:2), 24:4; 1=normal, 2=mild impairment
* ECOG PS (0:1), 6:22;

## Sample Collection
### PK Sampling
* Cycle 1
    + Day 1: 0, 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 6, and 12 (bid) or 24 (qD)
    + Day 8: Pre-dose
    + Day 15: 0, 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 6 and 12 (bid) or 24 (qD)
    + Day 22: Pre-dose
* All remaining cycles
    + Day 1: Pre-dose

### SDMA
* Cycle 1
    + Day 1: 0, 2, 6, and 12 (bid) or 24 (qD)
    + Day 8: Pre-dose
    + Day 15: 0, 2, 6, and 12 (bid) or 24 (qD)
    + Day 22: Pre-dose
* Remaining Cycles
    + Day 1: Pre-dose

### Hematology
* Cycle 1
    + Day 1, 8, 15, 22: Pre-dose
* Remaining Cycles
    + Day 1, 15: Pre-dose

## Results
* Chose to simulate using once-daily dosing (0.5-12mg)
* Number of cycles simulated unclear
* On Day 15 (assume cycle 1) 
    + 4mg PO q24h probability of target attainment was 64% while probability of G3 AE was 17%
    + 6mg PO q24h probability of target attainment was 76% while probability of G3 AE was 30%
    + 8mg PO q24h probability of target attainment was 81% while probability of G3 AE was 43%
* Chose to move forward with 6mg PO q24h

# CTS Exercise

## Rationale
For each simulation in the manuscript, all subjects were given the same dose of PF06 without an opportunity to modify their dose based upon either PD response. It's possible that allowing for dose modification could increase the probability of target attainment while further minimizing the risk of serious adverse events. This is a commonly encountered, difficult-to-answer question from Phase 1B/Phase 2 drug development.

## Key Questions
1. What are the predicted outcomes (safety, efficacy) for 4-8mg PO q24h regimens without dose adjustment?
2. Can the predicted benefit/risk profile be improved by starting at 6 mg PO q24h while allowing for dose adjustment based upon outcomes?
3. Would a lower starting dose (4 mg PO q24h) in combination with dose adjustment further alter the predicted benefit/risk profile?
4. Would early safety evaluation (cycle day 7) in addition to cycle day 15 prevent subjects from experiencing more severe AEs?


## Guidelines

### DRY principle
* If typing it more than twice, turn it into a function

```
a = (b + c) * 4
d = a/2

e = (f + g) * 4
h = e/2

function f(var1, var2)
    x = (var1 + var2) * 4/2
    return x
end
```

### Modularization
* The trial workflow should be controlled by a single "main" function that calls additional "helper" functions as needed.
* Each trial action (e.g., dose titration) should be implemented as a separate function
    + Create a mechanism to test/validate each function

```
function mytrial()

    f1()

    f2()

    f3()

    return result

end
```

### Data Structures
* Dataframes are computationally expensive; try to avoid during simulation.
    + Try to stick with built-in types (named tuples, dictionaries, Pumas constructors); can be challenging!
* Dataframes store more than just tabular data which makes the ideal for storing the result of a set of simulations

### User-Defined Types
* Scenario: a named tuple of keyword options that will be used to change how simulations are conducted

```
(
    STARTINGDOSE = 4,
    DAYSOFTHERAPY = 15
)
```

* Trial Events: a `NamedTuple` that stores key information for each simulated "visit"

```
(
    day = 7,
    pkval = 92.3,
    pdval = 50.1,   
)
```

* Patient: a dictionary used to store multi-type data about the "experimental unit" 
    + A dataframe might work but they're expensive
    + A NamedTuple would be difficult to use because, once created, the stored values are difficult to edit

```
patient = Dict(
    "id" => 1,
    "trialdetail1" => DataFrame,
    "trialdetail2" => Dict("key1" => 1, "key2" => [1,2,3])?
)
```

## Execution

* First, get things working for a single patient then worry about scaling up!
* Start from a dataframe of patients where each row represents a unique patient.
* Map over each row in the dataframe, simulating a full set of observations for each patient and storing them in a new df column.

```
df[!, :sim] = map(eachrow(df)) do r
    mytrial(r, 3) # example of 3 cycles
end
```

* Multiple Scenarios (runs) will need to be explored and our goal is to use distributed processing to accomplish that quickly
* The results of each distributed run will be combined in a single dataframe which is the input for post processingdataframe

```
 Row │ run    pop    scenario  
─────┼────────────────────────
   1 │     1      1  BASELINE
   2 │     2      1  SCENARIO1
```
