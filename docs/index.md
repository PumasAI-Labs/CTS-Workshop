This hands-on workshop is designed for experienced scientists leading MIDD projects
to support key drug development and regulatory decisions.
MIDD has been used to alleviate Phase 3 trials, evaluate efficacy
or safety-guided precision dosing,
accelerate drug development for oncology and rare diseases,
set regulatory policy and support surrogate selection.

Pumas modeling and simulation workflows feature a flexible
and powerful interface for you to seamlessly setup simulations models,
create patient populations, simulate clinical trials using high-performance computing
and determine probability of technical success.
Pumas allows end-to-end project execution at lightening speeds.
The workshop will cover a case-study featuring a full clinical trial simulation workflow.

At the end of the workshop, participants will:

- Learn good-simulation-practices.
- Gain an overview of the Pumas modelling and simulation ecosystem.
- Learn how to generate patient populations under specific inclusion/exclusion criteria.
- Learn how to perform simulation qualifications.
- Master how to boost computational power to perform large simulations.
- Learn how to perform post-processing and visualizations of simulations for reporting.
- Understand the strategy behind precedent-setting MIDD case-studies

!!! success "Prerequisites"

    We recommend users having experience with pharmacometric workflows,
    such as population-pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic modeling (PKPD),
    while also being familiar with Julia syntax, especially variables and types.

The following Julia files are provided:
